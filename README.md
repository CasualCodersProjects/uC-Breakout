#  ÂµC USB 2.0 Type C Breakout Board
I like USB C, You like USB C. We all like USB C.  
But there's one thing missing from all the cheap USB Type C breakout boards on the market, and that is support for USB C to C cables.  
This board solves that by following the basic spec and inclusing the two 5k1 pull-down resistors. It also maintains a small and light footprint to make integration easy. Finally, it breaks out all the pins on the type C 2.0 connector, which includes: VCC, GND, D+, D-, CC1, CC2, SBU1, and SBU2.
